## Problem 

So , Many league of legends players have a problem where many games are missed when they're queuing up for a game. Queue times might be a little long and when a match is found the player isn't probably there
Maybe they went to eat , walk a dog and having actual life.

## GOLOL solution

So the GOLOL solution which made in Golang solves this problem , once an "Accept" message appears. The GOLOL automator will automatically accept the game.

*This is a training project for Golang capabilities in running automating softwares , I'm also still learning and bit newbie in GOlang , so If you have any feedbacks it'll be helpful*
